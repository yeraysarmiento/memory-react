# Memory

This is my first game developed in React with Javascript, it is based in an exercise from FrontendMentor but I took it my own way.

It is turn-based Memory game where you can choose the theme of the board, as well as the number of players and the size of the grid.

Memory has been developed 1 week after finishing my ISDI Coders full-stack development bootcamp.


## Technologies

The front-end has been built with React.js, Javascript & SASS, deployed in Netlify.

All the app has been tested with Jest, with more than the 95% covered lines.
